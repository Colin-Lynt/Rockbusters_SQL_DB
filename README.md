# Rockbusters_SQL_DB
Rockbusters is a fictional company that has hired me as a data analyst to help launch an online video rental service to stay competitive. I work with the business intelligence department to help with the strategy for the new online video service by implementing SQL queries that identify customer, movie, and video rental patterns. I also analyze the data and answer any ad-hoc business questions other departments may have.
