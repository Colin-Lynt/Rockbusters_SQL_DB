# Rockbusters Stealth Data Analytics Project (SQL)

## About Rockbusters
Rockbusters is a fictional company that has hired me as a data analyst to help launch an online video rental service to stay competitive. I work with the business intelligence department to help with the strategy for the new online video service by implementing SQL queries that identify customer, movie, and video rental patterns. I also analyze the data and answer any ad-hoc business questions other departments may have.

## Key Questions
The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions and they expect data-driven answers that they can use for their 2020 company strategy. Here are the main questions theyâ€™d like to answer:

- Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
- What was the average rental duration for all videos?
- Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
- Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
- Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

## About The Data
The data was provided by my data analytics course, **Career Foundry**. The data is a relational database containing infromation about Rockbuster's film inventory, customers, and payments, amoung other things.
